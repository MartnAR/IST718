1,Jesus Luzardo,LHP,9/30/1997,"6'1""",205,L,L,"Drafted 94th overall in the 2016 draft, Stoneman-Douglas HS (Parkland, FL); signed for $1.4 million. ",#4 (org.) #88 (Top 101),"1.23 ERA, 1.70 DRA, 14.7 IP, 6 IP, 5 BB, 25 K in 3 games at High-A Stockton; 2.29 ERA, 3.40 DRA, 78.7 IP, 58 H, 18 BB, 86 K in 16 games at Double-A Midland; 7.31 ERA, 2.90 DRA, 16 IP, 25 H, 7 BB, 18 K in 4 games at Triple-A Nashville","Luzardo is one of the most polished and skilled pitchers you’ll see in the minor leagues. He has a relatively short pitcher’s frame and doesn’t have overly long levers, but is a plus athlete with quality quick twitch and coordination. He has very clean arm action and while his delivery can be a bit rotational, he has no trouble repeating his release point. He sits 93-95 with the four-seam fastball and has average command of the offering. His primary secondary is a plus 85-86 changeup with good arm speed, tumble, and some fade. Luzardo was obviously working on finding consistency with his breaking ball in the two starts I saw him, but the 82-84 curve flashed plus multiple times, with plus depth and spin. The pitch has both vertical and horizontal break when located at the knees or higher, but the bottom drops out when he throws it below the zone. Luzardo also showed impressive pitchability, as he was comfortable using his breaking ball early in counts to surprise the hitter for an easy strike one. He threw his changeup sparingly and was able to get hitters to whiff just by locating his fastball and breaking ball. Luzardo profiles as a No. 3 starter on a first division team with a real possibility at being one of the better pitchers in the game if his command develops further.",70—No. 2 starter,60—No. 3 starter
2,A.J. Puk,LHP,4/25/1995,"6'7""",220,L,L,"Drafted 6th overall in the 2016 draft, University of Florida (Gainesville, FL); signed for $4.0692 million.",#1 (org.) #30 (Top 101),DNP," There’s an alternate timeline where Puk doesn’t blow out his UCL last spring and carves up the minors on the way to a fabulous late-season debut and Wild Card game start. Despite their surprise 2018 playoff run, the A’s might have preferred that fork in the multiverse as well, as they enter 2019 with Yusmeiro Petit among their best five starting options. But you can’t change the past—even if you have Jose Canseco’s time machine—and pitchers of all stripes break. Puk won’t be ready for Opening Day 2019, but you should see him sometime in the summer.
Before the injury the stuff was, well, good enough to rank Puk as a top 30 prospect in baseball. He hits the mid-90s—sometimes higher—from the left side with premium extension and deception, a slider that looked like a potential 7 on its good days—and mechanical issues that left him struggling at times to throw enough strikes. The stuff was good enough that it didn’t really matter in the minors, but we will have to see how much of it comes back from surgery. (Anecdotally, I tend to be more concerned about the “bad mechanics” dudes coming back, but that’s a personal predilection with no real science backing it). There was always a fair bit of reliever risk in the profile, but with that two-pitch combo, Puk would have closer stuff.",60—No. 3 starter or closer,50—No. 4 starter or setup  
3,Sean Murphy,C,10/10/1994,"6'3""",215,R,R,"Drafted 83rd overall in the 2016 draft, Wright State University; signed for $753,100",#10 (org),".200/.200/400, 0 HR, 0 SB in 2 games at Rookie League AZL Athletics; .288/.358/.498, 8 HR, 3 SB in 68 games at Double-A Midland; .250/.500/.250, 0 HR, 0 SB in 3 games at Triple-A Nashville","Murphy is the best defender among the top tier catching prospects in baseball right now. He flashes a plus-plus arm and is an athletic backstop who draws raves for his receiving and staff management already. There are minor durability concerns, as he’s missed time with a broken hamate in both 2016 and 2018, but those tend to be more freakish type things, and he doesn’t have a third one to break anyway. As a potential 70-grade defender behind the plate, Murphy won’t have to hit much to be a major-league regular. He has plus raw power in his locker though, and has had some success getting to it in games (it’s worth mentioning that he’s generally been old for the level at his minor-league stops). The swing is a bit stiff, although that has manifested more in poor quality of contact than swing-and-miss so far. But even with a below-average hit tool and average pop, Murphy’s glove is good enough to make him a solid regular. Anything past that, and he could play in a few all-star games.   ",60—Defensive-minded catcher with enough pop to be a plus regular,50—Glove-first average backstop  
4,Kyle Murray,OF/QB,8/7/1997,"5'11""",195,R,R,2019 NFL Draft eligible,#1 (Heisman Trophy),"4361 Yds, 42 TD/7 INT, 69 percent passing, 140 rushing attempts for 1001 yards and 12 TD in 14 games at FBS University of Oklahoma","Murray originally signed with Texas A&M out of high school as a five-star quarterback recruit, and was widely regarded as the best prep football player in the country. He platooned for the Aggies in 2015 as a true freshman before transferring to Oklahoma where he initially played sparingly behind Baker Mayfield. Murray won a 2018 camp battle to claim Oklahoma’s starting role after reaching a deal with the A’s to play his redshirt junior football season while under a baseball contract. He proceeded to have one of the best seasons in college football history, usurping Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa for the Heisman Trophy, and leading Oklahoma to the Orange Bowl. Meanwhile, Murray had a parallel career in baseball. He was also considered a first-round MLB Draft prospect out of high school, but removed his name from the draft pool entirely. He didn’t play baseball at all at A&M, but did join the Sooners as a sophomore in 2017. He scuffled badly initially, and scuffled some more in the Cape Cod League that summer. But then he had a brilliant junior campaign, establishing himself once more as a top baseball player for his class as an athletic five-tool center field prospect. This time he was interested in a career on the diamond, and the A’s drafted him ninth overall and signed him for $4.66 million, only very slightly below slot value. Despite his recruiting pedigree, Murray was not considered a particularly great NFL quarterback prospect until this past fall, which was why the A’s felt reasonably secure drafting him in the top ten and letting him play an additional season of football. He’s small—quarterbacks generally have to be over six feet to be high draft picks—and he just hadn’t played enough in college to overcome the height issue perception. But the NFL is changing to a quick passing, dynamic offensive league built around run/pass options and space plays, and Murray is a perfect fit for the new wave of football. Mayfield made a similar late rise in Lincoln Riley’s system at Oklahoma, and he exploded on the NFL scene in 2018. Combine all that with a weak quarterback class, and all of a sudden Murray is the talk of the gridiron in a way Oakland couldn’t have expected when drafting him. We’re reading tea leaves here, but it seems more likely at this moment in time that he’s going to play professional football—and only professional football—moving forward.",70 — Elite dual-threat quarterback,60 — Long-term starter and occasional Pro Bowler
5,Lazaro Armenteros,OF,5/22/1999,"6'0""",182,R,R,Signed July 2016 by the Athletics out of Cuba for $3 million. ,#8 (org.),".277/.374/.401, 8 HR, 8 SB in 79 games at Low-A Beloit","Two months into the season, Lazarito looked like a sure shot 2019 Top 101 name. A polished outfielder with potential plus hit and power tools off to a good start in full-season ball at 19? Yes please. Even after a quad injury cost him a month, he made the honorable mentions for the midseason 50. Lazarito was a mess after coming back from his injury, so we are cooling our jets a little bit. While he didn’t quite look one hundred percent in the late summer, we don’t foresee any long term effects here. Given that he’s a far from a sure shot to stick up the middle, any lower body injuries are going to be a little concerning though, especially since his below-average arm would force him to left. You’re buying the bat here anyway, and despite a toe tap and leg kick for timing, Lazarito has fluid, well-balanced hitting mechanics married to a good approach and above-average barrel control. The plus power is mostly theoretical at this point, but the swing has some loft, and you’d expect him to add strength in his twenties. It wasn’t quite the breakout season we expected around Memorial Day, but it’s also hard to quibble with the overall performance from a teenager in the Midwest League. So while we aren’t firing the afterburners quite yet, we’ll keep the engine running.","60—Plus outfielder, maybe in center, but definitely bat first",50—Average left fielder
6,Austin Beck,OF,11/21/1998,"6'1""",200,R,R,"Drafted 6th overall in the 2017 draft, North Davidson HS (Lexington, NC); signed for $5.303 million.",#6 (org.),".296/.335/.383, 2 HR, 8 SB in 123 games at Low-A Beloit","Beck played well in the Midwest League last summer, looking every bit like the toolsy athlete the A’s envisioned when they popped him with the sixth overall pick in the 2017 draft. He made great strides at the plate, cleaning up his approach and reducing his strikeout rate. He still tends to chase breaking stuff but he adjusts well and has enough barrel control to project an average hit tool. He’s more of a doubles hitter than a true power threat at this point, but his plus raw will eventually play in games. Quick and athletic, he’s a plus runner who plays a quality centerfield. His instincts are sound and he’s got enough arm for right field if needed. There’s still no guarantee Beck hits upper-level arms, but he’s off to a good start. There’s plenty of upside remaining too, but to reach his ceiling as a first division centerfielder, he’ll need to get more of his raw power into games.",60—Plus center fielder,45—Second division outfielder
7,Grant Holmes,RHP,3/22/1996,"6'1""",215,L,R,"Drafted 22nd overall in the 2015 draft, Conway HS (Conway, SC); signed for $2.5 million; Acquired via trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers for Rich Hill and Josh Reddick.",#7 (org.),"4.50 ERA, 3.90 DRA, 6 IP, 4 H, 2 BB, 8 K in 2 games at High-A Stockton","I’ve been a fan of Holmes since his draft year, and it isn’t just the plus-plus flow. He’s never quite fully broken out, but looked well on his way to being a useful major-league arm by the close of the 2017 season. And hey, he was 21 and had a year of moderate Double-A success under his belt. Maybe 2018 would be the year he broke out? Instead, 2018 was the year he broke; pitchers, man. Holmes missed almost the full season with a rotator cuff injury. No one will confuse me with a doctor, but I believe that’s connected to the shoulder, and you don’t need to be a doctor to know that shoulder injuries for pitchers are, uh, bad. Very bad. When he did toe the rubber, the stuff looked more or less like it did in 2017: fastball up to 95, potential plus breaker, but six inning samples aren’t gonna keep you in a meaningful spot on a team’s prospect list. Amazingly though, he’s not even the riskiest or the least healthy arm on this list. Pitchers, man.",55—No. 3/4 starter or setup,40—Good middle-reliever  
8,James Kaprelian,RHP,3/2/1994,"6'4""",200,R,R,"Drafted 16th overall in the 2015 draft, UCLA (Los Angeles, CA); signed for $2.65 million; acquired via trade with the New York Yankees for Sonny Gray",#9 (org.),DNP,"It’s been over 33 months since Kaprielian last took the mound in a regular-season game. He missed most of 2016 with flexor problems, but came back and was fantastically impressive in the Arizona Fall League, with a big velocity spike causing his perceived upside to jump substantially—enough that he climbed into our top 101 that winter. He arrived in camp with the wind at his back and a chance to rocket through New York’s farm system and… immediately blew out his UCL. He was included in the Sonny Gray trade while rehabbing, and was expected to return to game action by midseason as an Oakland farmhand. He didn’t return at all, with a troubled rehab plagued by shoulder injuries, although he was throwing during instructs. He’s going to (hopefully) return in 2019 as a 25-year-old with 56⅓ innings, all in the low-minors or the AFL, and all in 2015 and 2016. The last time we saw Kaprielian toe the rubber regularly, he possessed top-of-the-rotation stuff: four pitches that projected above-average, led with a fastball sitting 94-97 and touching 99. Obviously, we have utterly no idea whether he can recapture that form, or maintain it in any type of regular pitching role. But it was good enough that he landed as the 58th best prospect in baseball back then, despite missing six months with a known Tommy John surgery precursor. It was good enough that he was a key part of a major trade while hurt. It was good enough that two years later, after a troubled rehab and without ever throwing a real pitch in their system, the A’s added him to the 40-man roster. And it was good enough that we’re still ranking him today.","55—The good Nathan Eovaldi, but less healthy","40—The bad Nathan Eovaldi, but less healthy"
9,Jorge Mateo,SS,6/23/1995,"6'0""",190,R,R,"Signed January 2012 by the Yankees out of the Dominican Republic for $250,000; acquired via trade with the New York Yankees for Sonny Gray","#3 (org), #79 (Top 101)",".230/.280/.353, 3 HR, 25 SB in 131 games at Triple-A Nashville","Mateo is one of the fastest players in the minors. He’s a premium athlete, full stop. He can play shortstop, center field, and second base, and presumably would be fine at the positions down the defensive spectrum from there. At times, he’s shown real flashes of power, and he wound up with 60 extra base hits in the minors in 2017. At the end of the day though, you can’t steal first base. Mateo hit .230 last year, in the PCL of all places. He’s not going to put together enough walks or power to make up for that level of bad hitting, and indeed the collapse in hitting ability torpedoed his non-speed secondary offensive skills too. In sum, he had a 58 DRC+ in Triple-A, worse than any regular hitter in the majors except for Chris Davis. We’ve had concerns about Mateo’s ability to hit for average since basically day one. He has good technical underpinnings in terms of swing plane, bat speed, and bat control, which has led to sporadic bursts of success at the plate. Unfortunately, his plate discipline and pitch recognition often limits him far more than it should. Those concerns were amplified when he spent a year-and-a-half puttering in High-A, and remain significant today. Mateo is still likely to have a substantial MLB career if things don’t work out with the stick, as his speed and defense will give him enough utility to survive in a bench role. But it might not be as a particularly valuable player unless he figures out a way to get to first. We might even suggest the Baltimore chop at this point.",50—Speedy super-utility guy or second-division starter,40—Speedy regular utility guy
10,Jameson Hannah,OF,8/10/1997,"5'9""",185,L,L,"Drafted 50th overall in the 2018 draft, Dallas Baptist University (Dallas, TX); signed for $1.8 million.",NR,".279/.347/.384, 1 HR, 6 SB in 23 games at Short-Season Vermont","Hannah played on a high-powered offense at Dallas Baptist and was pretty clearly the best player on the team due to his bat and ability in center. He is a plus athlete with good coordination and quick twitch. He has broad shoulders and an athletic build on a short frame that doesn’t have much room, if any, to put on weight without losing a step. Hannah has above-average feel for the barrel and plus bat speed, but his swing generates his hardest contact on low line drives and burners. His average raw power gets left by the wayside in most plate appearances. Hannah is willing to take walks, but struggles with the soft stuff. Hannah is currently a plus runner and he gets down the line very quickly from the left side. His jumps in center and plus footspeed give him plenty of range, although he will need to clean up his routes and reads to get the most out of his wheels. Hannah’s arm is fringy and will likely play best in left or center. Hannah’s athleticism and tools suggest a future as a versatile fourth outfielder who can get on base at a decent clip. If he can tap into more of his raw power without losing a step, he could play himself into regular work in center.",50—Average regular in center,40—Fourth outfielder
